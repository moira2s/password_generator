This is the random password generator I have made for myself so I  would not have to rely on the Google password manager to create a new password since it gets the password to some websites mixed up.

Languages used: Python (with Flask) and HTML/CSS

Foud the random.choices line from here: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-generate-random-string-of-given-length/#

Soon to be implemented:
1. A 'copy' button to make it easier to copy the generated password into your clipboard
2. UI changes

How to run program once cloning the repository:
1. Type "pip install flask" into your command line OR install the Flask extension if you're on Visual Studio Code
2. Run passwordGenerator.py by typing "python3 passwordGenerator.py" in your terminal or run it in your IDE.
3. Once the link for it is displayed, do "ctrl + click" on it and it will lead you to the generator.
